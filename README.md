# Crystal
A Garmin Connect IQ watch face.

## Description
A crystal clear watch face, with LCD-like goal meter segments, written while snow crystals were falling during an unusually cold spell of weather here in England.

Features:
- Big time digits right in the middle, with hours in bold.
- 3 customisable data fields: HR history, battery, notifications, calories, distance.
- 2 customisable goal meters: steps, floors climbed, active minutes (weekly). The meters have auto-scaling segments and current/target value display.
- Move bar.
- 4 colour themes.

The techie bit: to save your watch battery, the goal meters and move bar are drawn from a palette-restricted back buffer, for improved drawing performance, with minimal memory penalty.

This is my first ever Connect IQ watch face (please be kind!), so I look forward to your feedback, improving the watch face, and bringing it to more devices.
