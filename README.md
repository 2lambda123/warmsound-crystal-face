# Crystal
A Connect IQ watch face for Garmin watches.

## Description
Crystal, for clarity, and because it was mostly written during an unusual period of sustained cold and snowy weather here in the UK.

Features:
- Large, centralised time display, minutes and seconds distinguished by font weight.
- 3 customisable data fields: HR history, battery, notifications, calories, distance.
- 2 customisable goal meters: auto-scaling segments, current/target value display.
- Move bar.
- 3 colour themes.

The goal meters and move bar are drawn from a palette-restricted back buffer, for improved drawing performance, with minimal memory penalty.

This is my first ever Connect IQ watch face (please be kind!), so I look forward to your feedback, improving the watch face, and bringing it to more devices.
